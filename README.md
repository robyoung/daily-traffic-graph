# Basic Stacked Graph

This is a hacked together stacked graph to help with the launch stats.

To get started with it check it out and run the `setup.sh` from terminal. It will ask for your root password,
don't worry, this is just to install (pip)[https://github.com/pypa/pip] and (virtualenv)[http://www.virtualenv.org/].

Once you've installed them run `python app.py` and browse to `http://localhost:5000/`
