# Basic Stacked Graph

This is a hacked together stacked graph to help with the launch stats.

To get started with it check it out and run the `setup.sh` from terminal. It will ask for your root password,
don't worry, this is just to install [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/).
Then run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

Once you've set everything up run `python app.py` and browse to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
